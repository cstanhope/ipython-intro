Introduction
------------
These are notebooks I used during an Introduction to IPython Notebook talk I gave for EAST Knowledge (http://eastknow.org). I used IPython Notebook v2.0 for the talk, but I don't think I used any advanced features that require a particular version.

Using
-----
These easiest way to use these notebooks is to install IPython Notebook. Then execute:

::

   $ ipython notebook

Out of the directory where you have placed these files. This will also work on Windows.
